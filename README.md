# OCRemixUpdater
Keep your numbered OC ReMix collection up-to-date

Distributed with the permission of djpretzel

Setup instructions:
- Use the torrents available at http://ocremix.org/torrents to download
ReMixes 1 to 3000. Please do not use OCRemixUpdater to download these! djpretzel
will get mad at you (and me) for using all that precious bandwidth.
- Download OCRemixUpdater.zip and extract it somewhere. Make sure you have
OCRemixUpdater.jar and a lib folder next to it with two jars inside.
- Copy or move the remix database file remixes.lst to the folder where you have
all your numbered OC ReMixes.
- Double-click OCRemixUpdater.jar to run it. If this does not work on your
system, go into a command prompt, navigate to the folder containing this file,
and run java -jar OCRemixUpdater.jar .
- Follow the on-screen instructions. When you are prompted to choose the folder
with your remixes, find the folder that you put remixes.lst into.

Use instructions:
- Click List > Refresh to Current from Web. In the Downloader window that
appears, click Start. This reads the latest pages of posted ReMixes from
ocremix.org, and adds new remixes to the list in the main window.
- In the main window, click the Get checkbox next to any ReMixes you want to
download. Alternatively, select a range of remixes and click the Select or
Deselect button at the bottom of the screen to select or deselect all of them
for downloading.
- Click Remixes > Download Selected. In the Downloader window, click Start.
- Wait patiently for all your remixes to be downloaded!
- When the output shows "Done", you're all set! You can close the program.
Enjoy your ReMixes!

Using other features:
- Click File > Folder to choose a new ReMixes folder.
- Click List > Refresh All from Web if your remixes.lst somehow gets corrupted,
and for some reason you can't download a new one from GitHub. This will take a
while and is usually not necessary.
- Click List > Reread remixes.lst if you've been messing with remixes.lst in a
text editor and want OCRemixUpdater to reread it.
- Click List > Rescan Filesystem if you just copied-and-pasted a bunch of
remixes into the folder, and you want it to find them.
- Click Remixes > Mirrors... to pick which mirrors to download remixes from,
or edit them.
